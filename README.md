# bnuuy.garden

This is the repo of (the frontend of) my first personal website. 

## Why this project exists:
* Create an online presence for myself
* Learn Svelte/SvelteKit, Flask, SCSS and in general web-development
* Learn to create something I will actually use/show people
* Allow myself to make mistakes and let go of perfectionism
* Learn how to structure a project
* Allow me to do something creative
* Be a little silly :3

## Backend?

I'm using Flask as a simple backend that severes content (mainly text) as json to the frontend. 

For the blog I'm doing the same, it converts .md files with YAML-frontmatter into the appropriate json. It converts the markdown to HTML and also generates slugs etc. 

### Why Svelte/SvelteKit?

I have several project ideas that go beyond just CLI tools, and since I also like to think about the design of things, I needed to learn a frontend. This is where I got inspired by and followed the advice of [@Feuerhamster](https://lmke.dev/) and started to read the tutorial and documentation of Svelte/SvelteKit. Of course I could have picked other frameworks as well, but I needed to start somewhere, and this is where I started.  

### Why Flask?

Because I used it like a few times to toy around with, so I somewhat understood how it works.

## Special thanks:

* [@Feuerhamster](https://lmke.dev/) - I looked a lot at her website and learned a lot from her project
* [@G-Ritter](https://github.com/G-Ritter/) - Answered so many of my questions and had the patience to explain web development concepts to me
* [@orangecms](https://github.com/orangecms) - Helping me with nasty hick-ups that got me stuck and helping me with nginx :3
